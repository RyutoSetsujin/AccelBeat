# **AccelBeat**
AccelBeat is a Stepmania theme focused for dance games such as DDR, Pump It Up and ITG, that aims to bring a fresh news experience to players, with flashy graphics like arcade games (soonâ„¢), streamlined game flow and advanced functionalities to help you improve your play. Intended for use on [OutFox](https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox/), the most active Stepmania fork that's being updated constantly with new features, bugfixes, and has extensive support for different game modes. 

# **Differences From The Original Build** 
## **Toasty Support**
*Work in Progress*
You can now select and use toasties!

## **OutFox Judgment Font Support**
*Work in Progress*
You now have the ability to either use the default judgment font or choose one of the ones you've added to your Appearance/Judgments folder!

# **Unique Features** 
## **Grid Music Selection**
Inspired on DDR A music select screen, AccelBeat features a very similar navigation fashion, containing sort modes and togglable song groups that remembers the player's selection between game sessions. 

## **Sorted Difficulties** 
Unlike most themes, charts are sorted by type, and then by meter difficulty, making it even easier to find what you're looking for.

## **Chart and Options Preview (coming soon)** 
With a custom-made options list that can be accessed at any time during the music select screen, you can preview not only the options you just selected, but also the currently selected chart.
